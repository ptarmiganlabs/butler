# Getting started


Sorry - there is no installer for Butler.  
You will need to work a bit on the command line to set things up.  

It's not as bad as it sounds though, a few pieces of software (most notably [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and some node modules) need to be installed, but the default options should be good to use, at least as of this writing.

Follow the [installation and configuration instructions](install-config.md) - they will guide through the setup process.
