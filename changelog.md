# v2.1
1. Switched to using YAML config files. JSON config files will still work, but YAML is superior when it comes to readability.
2. Updated to latest versions of modules that Butler uses.
3. Removed disk space REST endpoint. This was done due to difficulties in isntalling the Windows version of the library used to get disk metrics. A full Windows development environment was needed - but as this is typically not desirable on a production Windows server, this REST endpoint was removed.
4. Removed work-in-progress code for retrieving info from Github repositories. While still a good idea, such half-baked code should not be included in actual releases.
5. Improved handling of MQTT messages and MQTT related logging.
6. Added configuration option for setting MQTT broker's port.
7. Changed name of mqttConfig.brokerIP config option to be mqttConfig.brokerHost, to better align with other tools in the Butler family. 
8. Switched to using Enigma.js for talking to the Qlik Sense engine.
9. Fixed some minor issues relating to posting messages to Slack.
10. Generally improved and more consistent formatting of the source code.
