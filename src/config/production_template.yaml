  # General notes: 
  # - File and directory paths in this sample config file use Linux/Mac syntax, i.e. using forward slashes.
  #   Windows paths work just as well, just make sure to quote them with single or double quotes.

  # Logging configuration
  logLevel: info          # Log level. Possible log levels are silly, debug, verbose, info, warn, error
  fileLogging: false      # true/false to enable/disable logging to disk file
  logDirectory: log       # Directory where log files are stored (no trailing / )
  anonTelemetry: true     # Can Butler send anonymous telemetry data? 
                          # More info on whata data is collected: https://butler.ptarmiganlabs.com/docs/about/telemetry/
                          # Please consider leaving this at true - it really helps future development of Butler!
