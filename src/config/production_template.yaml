Butler:
  # General notes: 
  # - File and directory paths in this sample config file use Linux/Mac syntax, i.e. using forward slashes.
  #   Windows paths work just as well, just make sure to quote them with single or double quotes.
  # - All entries in the config file are mandatory in the sense that they must be present.
  #   However, if a feature is not used the corresponding config entries can contain 
  #   any value (for example the provided default ones).
  # - Butler will start using the settings in this file if the follwing settings are set first:
  #   - Butler.cert.clientCert: Set to the path of the client certificate file. If relative paths cause issues, use an absolute path.
  #   - Butler.cert.clientCertKey: Set to the path of the client key file. If relative paths cause issues, use an absolute path.
  #   - Butler.cert.clientCertCA: Set to the path of the CA certificate file. If relative paths cause issues, use an absolute path.
  #   - Butler.configEngine.host: Set to the IP or FQDN of the host where the Sense engine service is running.
  #   - Butler.configEngine.port: Set to the port where the Sense engine service is listening.
  #   - Butler.configQRS.host: Set to the IP or FQDN of the host where the Qlik Repository Service (QRS) is running.
  #   - Butler.configQRS.port: Set to the port where the Qlik Repository Service (QRS) is listening.
  # - Having set the above settings, Butler will start and run, but it will not do anything useful until you configure
  #   the various monitoring and notification settings, as described at https://butler.ptarmiganlabs.com.

  # Logging configuration
  logLevel: info          # Log level. Possible log levels are silly, debug, verbose, info, warn, error

  # Docker health checks are used when running Butler as a Docker container.
